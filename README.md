## Introduction

This system provides a comprehensive platform for managing questions, categories, and users. Whether you're a question setter, reviewer, or administrator, this system streamlines the process of creating and reviewing questions, ensuring quality and organization.

## Features

- **Question Bank**: Access a centralized repository of approved and rejected questions.
- **Category Management**: Organize questions into categories for easy navigation.
- **User Management**: Admins can create, edit, and block users with specified roles.
- **Review System**: Efficiently review and approve questions submitted by setters.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for seamless navigation and operation.

## Usage

### Question Bank

Once a question has been reviewed by all reviewers and admin, it will appear in the question bank section. To view which questions are already in the question bank, activate "Added". To see rejected questions, switch back to "Rejected".

### Adding Questions

Navigate to the question tab and click the create button to add a new question. Questions automatically enter the review phase upon creation. Edit questions before reviewers' approval if necessary. Once a question enters the question bank, it cannot be deleted.

### Reviewing Questions

Review questions submitted by setters under the assigned category. Choose to approve or reject questions and optionally add comments. View reviews from other reviewers alongside the question.

### Managing Categories

Create categories from the category tab. Deleting a category automatically creates an uncategorized category. Questions under deleted categories move to the uncategorized category.

### User Management

Admins can create users with specified roles and edit user details at any time. Block users to revoke their access.

## Running the Project Locally
